Ideas/TODO:s

1.) Store every search by date, (for a couple of months or weeks before evicts.) Then store user searches somewhere. Every night then run a job, then compare the search from older date with new date, the diff should be interisting to see if any new products and then send mail to the customer with news for the search....heads up for products missing and then appears again.

2.)  Spring CLI to evict and create test data, good to have from the start to easy recreate test setups.

3.) Contract Test and run inmemory elastic for Integration test

4.) Store all ingested data in HDFS for later jobs to use, like prics osv osv..store whole html page for product not just data interested in...

5.) Version handling of rest endopint, wrap product in other objects such as Proudct_V1 and so on...and use converters to be able to backwards compatible. 

6.) Add docker/docker-compose for easy running test system.

7.) Add spring profile also for developer mode, then start elastic in memory when running developer...

8.) Look into CRaSH, could be added to all services for ssh to running application..

9.) Jmx monitoring...


Whats next
---------------
1.) Add prodcuts with real values, shell app commited, use it to ingest test data into product service, and also clear data...
	- Added first working code with post product to prodcut-service., done
	- Next, delete all data.., done
	- Add json data as resource file that is useed to populate product-service, done
2.) Fix id:s for products when creating, done
3.) Images service...with product ids, servive (done) + add with shell, done..left to do is real data
