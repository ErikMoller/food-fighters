Ideas/TODO:s

1.) Store every search by date, (for a couple of months or weeks before evicts.) Then store user searches somewhere. Every night then run a job, then compare the search from older date with new date, the diff should be interisting to see if any new products and then send mail to the customer with news for the search....heads up for products missing and then appears again.

2.)  Spring CLI to evict and create test data, good to have from the start to easy recreate test setups.

3.) Contract Test and run inmemory elastic for Integration test

4.) Store all ingested data in HDFS for later jobs to use, like prics osv osv..store whole html page for product not just data interested in...

5.) Version handling of rest endopint, wrap product in other objects such as Proudct_V1 and so on...and use converters to be able to backwards compatible. 

6.) Add docker/docker-compose for easy running test system.


Whats next
---------------
1.) Add prodcuts with real values
2.) Get search up and running with simple search + filter, then a full working product-service is up and running.
3.) Start with gui
